  abstract = {Complete fusion excitation functions for \$\^\{9\}\$Be + \$\^\{208\}\$Pb have been measured to high precision at near barrier energies. The experimental fusion barrier distribution extracted from these data allows reliable prediction of the expected complete fusion cross-sections. However, the measured cross-sections are only 68\% of those predicted. The large cross-sections observed for incomplete fusion products support the interpretation that this suppression of fusion is caused by \$\^\{9\}\$Be breaking up into charged fragments before reaching the fusion barrier. Implications for the fusion of radioactive nuclei are discussed.},

  abstract = {A classical dynamical model that treats break-up stochastically is presented for low energy reactions of weakly-bound nuclei. The three-dimensional model allows a consistent calculation of breakup, incomplete and complete fusion cross sections. The model is assessed by comparing the breakup observables with CDCC quantum mechanical predictions, which are found to be in reasonable agreement. Through the model, it is demonstrated that the breakup probability of the projectile as a function of its distance from the target is of primary importance for understanding complete and incomplete fusion at energies near the Coulomb barrier.},

  abstract = {Since the first date of publication of this book in 1991, the subject of phosphors and luminescence has assumed even more importance in the overall scheme of technological development. Many new types of displays have appeared which depend upon phosphors in their operation. Some of these were pure conjecture in 1991 but are a reality in 2004. Descriptions have been included of the newer (as well as the older) types of displays in this edition along with an annotated portrait of the phosphors used in each category. Many of these new light sources promise to displace and make obsolete our current light sources, such as incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps and the ubiquitous colour Cathode Ray Tube now used in TV and computer monitors. The importance of solid state science are summarized in the introductory chapters of this edition, and many of the chapters have been completely rewritten or revised. Each chapter has a special contribution to make in the overall understanding of the solid state science of phosphors and luminescence. - Introduces the reader to the science and art of preparing inorganic luminescent materials. - Describes how and why luminescent materials exhibit such specific intrinsic properties. - Describes the science of the solid state and presents the exact formulas and conditions required to make all of the phosphors known at that time.},
