Thoughts on CoVID-19 situation.

Q: Are you happy considering the prospect of analysing data for the next few months as plan B?

A: First and foremost, I am not sure what the alternative is, in terms of other ways to produce a thesis given the tools available to us. Given that in the ideal world where we get to run our experiments, we will be spending a fair bit of time analysing the data we produce, this is a good contingency plan, as it seems to be the "next best thing" in terms of straying as little as possible from the original plan. 

Ultimately, I am happy with this as a plan B and wouldn't mind seeing what there is to uncover from whatever datasets I end up with in this hypothetical scenario. 

Q: How are you situated, in terms of being able to work from home?

I have a desk and a chair that is fairly close to my set up in the nuclear physics building, so all I would really need would be my monitor and computer, which I could readily transport home given its only 500m or so from the lab. 

I will need to acquire a webcam for Zoom meetings to be worthwhile, since the webcam on my laptop does not work (it hasn't for years and I have not yet found a solution). 

I will also need to check things like whether accessing the server via the ANU physics VPN works from home and "nitty gritty" details like that. It might also be worth installing SRIM/TRIM on my PC so that I can use them there if I don't have my monitor and RSPE computer at home.
