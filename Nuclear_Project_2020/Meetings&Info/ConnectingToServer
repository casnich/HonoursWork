new approach for connecting to server (on Mac or Ubuntu)

connect to anuvpn.anu.edu.au using Cisco AnyConnect

ssh into nucl03 server using nuc alias

enter password when prompted

Run `vncserver` from on server to start a new desktop the server (typically it will be 'nucl03:2'). After this you can always just run `vncviewer` and connect to nucl03:2 (for now). 

Run `vncviewer`

Enter nucl03:2 (or whatever was returned in `New 'nucl03:x (cwn103)' desktop is `nucl03:x`) into the popup that appears.

Enter password (quet). You are now on the server

To kill vncserver connections that are no longer needed, run `kill vncserver :x` (on Ubuntu) where x is the connection number (this will have been given in `nucl03:x` when it was started).
